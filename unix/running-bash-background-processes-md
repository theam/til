# Running Bash background processes properly

We always are used to the usual `command &`

But this is not very useful if we close the terminal, as it will terminate the process.

If you run `disown` after that, it will leave the process in the background.

It will be completely unlinked from the current terminal session, so even if you close it,
your process will keep running.
